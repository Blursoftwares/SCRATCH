# Scratch

Scratch is a visual programming language that enables young people to create their own interactive games, stories, and animations by connecting together programming blocks. Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing (Accessible to all, helping to close the gap between different groups of people in tech.).

## Getting Started
* To start using Scratch, download the app
* Scratch is also available as a web application, where one can create their own account. You can use this [link](https://scratch.mit.edu) to access the Scratch documentation and web application.

## Key Terms
1. **Sprite**: A character or object in your Scratch project. It can be anything, like a person, animal, or item.
2. **Script**: A set of instructions that tells a sprite what to do. It’s like a recipe for how to make your project work.
3. **Block**: The building pieces of scripts. Each block represents a specific action or command, like moving a sprite or playing a sound.
4. **Backdrop**: The background of your project. It sets the scene for where your sprites are.
5. **Costume**: The different appearances that a sprite (character or object) can have.
6. **Stage**: This is the main area where your project happens. It’s like the screen where you see your sprites and backdrops interact. When you run your project, the stage shows everything in action.
7. **Script Area**: This is where you build your scripts for the sprites. It’s like a workspace where you drag and drop blocks to create the instructions for what your sprites will do.
8. **Event**: An action that starts a script, like when you click on a sprite or press a key.
9. **Variable**: A storage place for information, like a score or time. You can change it during the project.
